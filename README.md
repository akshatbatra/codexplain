## CodeXplain

You will need some environment variables (API Keys) to get this extension running locally, if you are a hackathon judge, reach out to me at akshatbatra25@gmail.com and I will be happy to quickly provide you the same.

Instructions:
1.) Run `npm install`.
2.) Navigate to ai-server folder and run `fastify start server.js`.
3.) Navigate to `extension.ts` in VS code and press F5 to experience the extension once you have set the environment variables receieved from me.
